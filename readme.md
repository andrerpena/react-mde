# react-mde

A simple yet powerful and extensible Markdown Editor editor for React. React-mde is built on top of [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/).

## Demos

- [Demos](http://andrerpena.me/react-mde/).

## Installing

    npm i --save react-mde

## Dependencies

React-mde currently depends on:

- [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/). This facilitates features that would otherwise be quite
difficult. The best examples being history management, mentions and pasting files.
<!-- -->

    npm i --save draft-js

- [Font Awesome 5.*](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons. This is not a hard dependency and can be changed (see the **Customizing Icons** section below).
To use Font Awesome icons, install [using your preferred method](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js).
The easiest is just add this to `<head/>`:
<!-- -->

    <script defer src="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.6/js/all.js"></script>
 
## Optional dependencies

- [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown). React-mde is not opinionated as to how to transform markdown into HTML and this can be done both in client-side,
like StackOverflow, or in server-side, like GitHub. The easiest way is to use Showdown and process it in client-side. If you
decide to do so, install Showdown:
<!-- -->

    npm i --save showdown

## Using

React-mde is a completely controlled component.

Minimal example using Showdown:
```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import ReactMde, {ReactMdeTypes} from "../src";
import * as Showdown from "showdown";

export interface AppState {
    mdeState: ReactMdeTypes.MdeState;
}

export class App extends React.Component<{}, AppState> {

    converter: Showdown.Converter;

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            mdeState: null,
        };
        this.converter = new Showdown.Converter({tables: true, simplifiedAutoLink: true});
    }

    handleValueChange = (mdeState: ReactMdeTypes.MdeState) => {
        this.setState({mdeState});
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="container">
                <ReactMde
                    onChange={this.handleValueChange}
                    editorState={this.state.mdeState}
                    generateMarkdownPreview={(markdown) => Promise.resolve(this.converter.makeHtml(markdown))}
                />
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

### Customizing Icons

By default, React-mde will use Font Awesome class names to render icons (see above for how to install).
The default icon provider returns icons that look like the following:

```jsx
<i className={`fas fa-${icon}`} aria-hidden="true"/>
```

This can be changed by passing a `buttonContentOptions` prop to the `ReactMde` component with an `iconProvider` option to tell React-mde how to render icons.

For example, you can use your own custom icon component by changing the `iconProvider`:

```jsx
<ReactMde
    buttonContentOptions={{
        iconProvider: name => <MyCustomIcon name={name} />,
    }}
    onChange={this.handleValueChange}
    // ...
/>
```

## Custom props
[See doccs](docs/customButton.md "See doccs")

## React-mde Props

The types are described below

- **editorState: MdeState**: The [state of the editor](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde/blob/master/src/types/MdeState.ts). 
It contains the markdown, the HTML and the underlying Draft.js state. However, only *markdown* is supposed to be passed
by the user on the first call. Both *html* and *draftEditorState* will be 
generated by React-mde and passed back to the user through the *onChange* callback. It is important to notice that, even
though on the first call, *editorState* is supposed to be something like `{markdown:'Hello!`}`, on the subsequent calls,
*editorState* should be the object returned by the *onChange* callback.
- **className?: string**: Optional class name to be added to the top level element.
- **commands?: Command[][]**: An array of array of commands. If no commands are specified, the default will be used. Commands are explained in more details below.
- **buttonContentOptions?: { iconProvider: (iconName: string) => React.ReactNode }** An optional set of button content options, including an `iconProvider` to allow custom icon rendering.
- **onChange: (value: [MdeState](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde/blob/master/src/types/MdeState.ts)) => void**: Event handler for the `onChange` event.
- **generateMarkdownPreview: (markdown: string) => Promise<string>;**: Function that should return the generated HTML for the preview. If this `prop` is falsy, then no preview is going to be generated.
- **layout?: string**: The name of the layout to be used. For now, the supported layouts are : `vertical`, `horizontal`, `tabbed` and `noPreview`.
- **layoutOptions?: any**: An object with options to be passed to the `layout-component`. Each layout may or may not expect
options. It is recommended to [inspect the layouts source code](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde/tree/master/src/components-layout) to see what options can be passed to each
while the documentation is not complete. 
-- **readOnly?: boolean**: Flag to render the editor in read-only mode.

## Styling

The following styles from React-mde should be added: (Both .scss and .css files are available. No need to use sass-loader if you don't want)

Easiest way: import `react-mde-all.css`:

    import 'react-mde/lib/styles/css/react-mde-all.css';
    
If you want to have a more granular control over the styles, you can [import each individual file](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde/tree/master/src/styles).
    
If you're using SASS, you can override these variables: https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde/blob/master/src/styles/variables.scss

You also need Font Awesome for the toolbar icons. Font Awesome 5 [can be installed in different ways](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js),
but the easiest is just adding this to the `<head/>`:

    <script defer src="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.6/js/all.js"></script>

## XSS concerns

React-mde does not automatically sanitize the HTML preview. If your using Showdown,
this has been taken from [their documentation](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Markdown's-XSS-Vulnerability-(and-how-to-mitigate-it)):
    
> Cross-side scripting is a well known technique to gain access to private information of the users
of a website. The attacker injects spurious HTML content (a script) on the web page which will read 
the user’s cookies and do something bad with it (like steal credentials). As a countermeasure,
 you should filter any suspicious content coming from user input. Showdown doesn’t include an 
 XSS filter, so you must provide your own. But be careful in how you do it…
 
You might want to take a look at [showdown-xss-filter](https://github.com/VisionistInc/showdown-xss-filter).

## Commands

React-mde allows you to use the build-in commands, implement your own commands, or both. If you wish
to implement your own commands, please refer to the [commands source code](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde/tree/master/src/commands) to understand how they
should be implemented.

## Composition and custom layouts

React-mde is designed to be composable and to facilitate new layouts:

![architecture](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde/blob/master/assets/architecture.png)

## Programmatically controlling text and selection

`DraftUtil.buildNewMdeState` can be used to programmatically create a new state based on the current state.
[Example with a button that duplicates the text](https://codesandbox.io/s/l4jlp3p5om). For the initial state, you can just pass null to `editorState` and React-Mde will build a new `MdeState` and call `onChange` with the first `MdeState`
